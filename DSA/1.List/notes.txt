# CREATING AN EMPTY LIST

# list_name = []     //empty list



# HOW TO INSERT ELEMENTS IN LIST

# append   :  Always insert/push element at end/at last index  => has 1 arg i.e data to be inserted
#             you can also append list,tuple etc
# insert   :  Insert value at required index  => has 2 args i.e data and position     list_name.insert(index,value)
#             (diff of position and index => index=position-1)
# extend   :  same as append but takes multiple values in one list,dict,tuple  =>  nested list
#             list_name.extend([1,2,3])



# HOW TO DELETE ELEMENTS IN LIST

# pop     :  indexed based deletion
#         :  by default remove last
# remove  :  value based deletion
# clear   :  clears the elements of list but structure remains same/empty list is returned
# delete  :  removes list itself/ pointer will be changed / address will not remain in our control
