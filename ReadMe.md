# Impact Training Repository

Welcome to my Impact Training repository! Here, I practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C and Python. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions, notes, and implementations as I work through various DSA problems.

## About

This repository contains my implementations, solutions, and notes on Data Structures and Algorithms. It's a platform for me to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

## Contents

- **C Codes:** This directory contains my DSA implementations and solutions in C programming language.
- **Python Codes:** Here, you'll find my DSA implementations and solutions in Python.
